I mean, you have to remember, Canada and the United States are each other\u2019s closest trading partners. The United States is a destination for about 80 percent of goods that Canada exports, including, for example, its oil and gas. And so this is a core existential economic relationship. And those tariffs that President Trump is threatening to slap on Canadian goods, they have the potential to derail the Canadian economy."
    },

        "speaker": "kim severson",
        "utterance": "Right, and we\u2019ve talked on the show before about the threat of tariffs and the way Trump justified them at the outset, is that he would be using them as a way of forcing our neighboring countries to reduce both migrant traffic and drug traffic from coming into the US. But these are not, seems to me, major problems at the border of Canada. So was there a sense among the Canadian government that this was about something else?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "matina stevis-gridneff",
        "utterance": "Absolutely. And I think where we really came to see this \u2014 and it took some time for the reporting to come together \u2014 is over the course of two phone calls that President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau held on February 3. So what happens on those calls is that President Trump lays down for Prime Minister Trudeau a number of grievances that he has with the economic and trade relationship between the two countries. These were generally well-known problems or concerns from the American side. The US wanted better access to the Canadian dairy market and the banking sector. But then President Trump raised something much more fundamental. He tells Trudeau \u2014 and apparently, he\u2019s reading off a memo, according to our sources \u2014 he tells Trudeau, and I don\u2019t like the border treaty between our two countries. This is a 1908 treaty that demarcates the boundary between the two nations. And President Trump just tells Prime Minister Trudeau he thinks it\u2019s not valid and should be revisited. He also tells him he doesn\u2019t like the way the two countries share water. We know President Trump is really interested in Canada\u2019s water. He thinks Canada has too much of it. And he also raised this to Trudeau, that he wants to revisit water agreements between the two countries. And so suddenly we go from \u201cI don\u2019t like the way we trade and how our economies are integrated\u201d to \u201cnice country you got there. Shame if something happened to it.\u201d"

        "speaker": "kim severson",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "matina stevis-gridneff",
        "utterance": "It was shock and anger and panic stations after that phone call. And Trudeau makes it quite clear that we\u2019re going to hit back on US products with our own tariffs if this threat materializes and becomes reality. And I think this is a good point to remind people \u2014 Trudeau is going through his last weeks in office. He has said he\u2019s going to resign, and we\u2019re expecting him to be out of government by the end of March. And so he takes this quite aggressive stance, even though he\u2019s almost out of government."

Can you tell me what you mean by that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "matina stevis-gridneff",
        "utterance": "Well, Kim, back in January, when this problem was gathering pace, Justin Trudeau was resigning. His party, the Liberal Party, who have been in power for nearly 10 years, were facing dismal polls. They were 20-plus percentage points behind the opposition, the conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre. And in the federal elections looming, it was sort of a foregone conclusion that the conservatives were going to win. Poilievre was going to be the new prime minister. He had these ideological and stylistic affiliations to the MAGA movement and the sort of more right-wing populist movement. And that was kind of what was going to happen in Canadian politics. But things started to rapidly change, just as Trump escalated his menacing rhetoric about Canadian sovereignty and went ahead with his tariff threats. Something, I mean, truly remarkable happens, and I spoke to pollsters. One of them, a really seasoned pollster, told me that he\u2019s never seen this in his entire career. We go from \u201cthe Liberal Party\u2019s dead, and they\u2019re going to be going into political exile for a long, long time\u201d to this liberal revival. The anti-US, anti-Trump sentiment is basically doing huge favors to the Liberal Party, even rehabilitating the image of Justin Trudeau to a certain extent, who was loathed to the extent that he had to resign in early January, right? And so it sets the scene for a stunning and pretty rapid reversal of fortunes for the Liberal Party as it goes into a leadership race to elect its new leader, the person who\u2019s going to replace Justin Trudeau as party chief and as prime minister."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "kim severson",
        "utterance": "So what happens?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "matina stevis-gridneff",
        "utterance": "Well, the party rallies in a dramatic way around one candidate. His name is Mark Carney. Mark Carney is not a politician. He\u2019s a political novice who hasn\u2019t held elected office, but has been in the public eye for many, many years, really his entire career. He was the governor of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis of 2008. And then he went on to become the governor of the Bank of England during Brexit."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "kim severson",
        "utterance": "So Canadians know him as a solid economics policy guy."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "matina stevis-gridneff",
        "utterance": "For sure. But people point out that Carney is not a natural-born politician. He\u2019s not oozing charisma. I think when he started his campaign in January, polling showed one in three Canadians only could recognize his photo, could name who he was. And nonetheless, the moment he\u2019s in and the anti-Trump sentiment, the fear and concern Canadians are feeling and the anger just turbocharges his campaign. So people are looking to Carney as someone who can potentially make a deal with Trump, but also steer the country through what will be a challenging economic period. People think he knows what he\u2019s doing. But Carney has a huge challenge in his hands. And that\u2019s that he has to be campaigning for his job as prime minister while being prime minister. He\u2019s expected to get sworn in any day now."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "kim severson",
        "utterance": "OK, can you remind me how this works? So he\u2019s serving as prime minister, and then he has to run fairly soon again as prime minister? Can you just give me the little Canadian Parliament 101?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "matina stevis-gridneff",
        "utterance": "Absolutely. It is a little complicated. But Canada has a sort of parliamentary system where the leader of the party in power is the prime minister. And so Mr. Carney has been elected as leader of the Liberal Party. And so he will be sworn in as prime minister. But by Canadian political rules, the country needs to hold an election by October. And so our expectation \u2014 and Mr. Carney\u2019s campaign has indicated this \u2014 is that he will call for a federal election really early on after he is sworn in, and seek to capitalize on his momentum to get a mandate at a national level from Canadians."

    {
        "speaker": "kim severson",

        "utterance": "Well, the conservatives are really trying to stage a pivot. They still have a solid chance at winning the federal election when it happens. According to polls, they\u2019re sort of neck and neck with Carney and the liberals. But their leader has to just do a whole new thing now. So what they\u2019re doing is they are really distancing themselves from President Trump, saying that the rhetoric and the threats coming out of the White House are not what they believe in. They\u2019re going to stand up to President Trump. And recently, President Trump gave an interview to a British magazine, and he said, oh, I\u2019m not so sure what I think about this Poilievre guy in Canada. He\u2019s not a MAGA guy. And boy, did Pierre Poilievre grab that opportunity."

        "utterance": "So the opposition party, the conservatives, need to reinvent themselves, frankly, more close to the center to have a fighting chance in the elections. So it\u2019s a kind of odd moment of political consensus in a country that was, five minutes ago, going through this incredibly polarizing political situation."

        "utterance": "Absolutely, Kim, and I think that\u2019s just been something really interesting to observe. There\u2019s clearly an existential crisis happening with the Canadian economy, and this huge breakdown in the relationship with the United States is driving it home. So both candidates and both parties are talking a lot about what a future of a successful Canada would look like, diversifying away from the United States dependence. And part of the reason they want to be doing this urgently is that the situation with the tariffs from the United States is like shifting sands. The one day, it\u2019s going to be 25 percent on everything. The next day, that\u2019s cancelled, but it\u2019s going to be 50 percent on steel. And so this is a very destabilizing situation for the Canadian economy. And Canada doesn\u2019t have a lot of other customers. They sell most of their stuff to Americans. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re looking much more toward Europe. I mean, half of Canadians, according to a recent poll, want to even join the European Union."

        "utterance": "I know. That\u2019s how far this is going. But they\u2019re also looking to improve other relationships. Right now, they\u2019re in a really tough spot with China, which is another top trading partner. The Chinese have imposed tariffs on Canada, sort of trying to squeeze them not to cut a deal with the United States on tariffs and trade. And so they\u2019re finding themselves in a really difficult position when they need to strategically rethink their global economic and trade links. And both the liberals and the conservatives are casting a wider net around the world for new best friends."

        "utterance": "Matina, in any good relationship, trust is essential. So in this relationship between the United States and Canada, let\u2019s say Trump goes back on the tariffs, decides that he wants things back to the way they were with Canada. Can the relationship be put back together again?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "matina stevis-gridneff",
        "utterance": "I mean, I think obviously, the breach of trust and the uncertainty has already caused a lot of damage, even economically. There\u2019s been market volatility. Investment has been frozen. And so folks are already hurting financially here in Canada. And of course, it goes deeper than that. There\u2019s a break in trust that feels really meaningful. Right now, it does feel kind of permanent. But it is conceivable that in the future, there could be perhaps different leaders on both sides, and those fences could be mended, but it will be on new terms. What I\u2019m seeing here in Canada is a really energized willingness to redefine what it is to be Canadian, both at home and on the world stage, through new economic relationships and more defined cultural references, too. I think even if this episode were to just end tomorrow, it would still have a lasting legacy of seeing a more clear, a more assertive, and a prouder, a more Canadian Canada."

That came as the European Union also hit back with new levies against American goods. Trump, who, earlier this week, declined to rule out the possibility that his economic policies would cause a recession, vowed to respond, saying, quote, \u201cOf course I\u2019ll hit back.\u201d We\u2019ll be right back."

In what the Trump administration is calling the \u201clargest deregulatory announcement in American history,\u201d the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday said it would unwind dozens of regulations, among them, protections for wetlands and limits on how much soot can pour from smokestacks. Most significantly, the administration plans to erase the EPA\u2019s legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that highlight the dangers of global warming."
